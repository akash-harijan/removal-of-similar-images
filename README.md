# removal-of-similar-images
This code removes similar images of a video as a pre-processing step for ML models.


# Image Data Cleaning Challenge

This repository contains a programming solution to identify and remove similar-looking images in a folder containing image data. 

## Challenge Description

At ML based organizations, the team deals with a significant amount of image and video data collected from various sources, such as cameras, for object recognition and evaluation purposes. As part of data organization, one optimization technique involves removing similar-looking images during data collection to streamline the dataset. This program should accept a path to a folder containing images as input and should remove duplicate or almost duplicate images that have only minor differences from the original.

## Provided Resources

In the provided `imaging_interview.py` script, you will find functions for image comparison, namely `preprocess_image_change_detection` and `compare_frames_change_detection`. To run the program use the 'main.py' script.

## Instructions

To compare images, follow these steps:
1. Run the 'main.py' script on a folder containing images.
